*adjusts glasses and cracks knuckles*

Alright, let's tear this apart. I've seen cleaner code in a dumpster fire.

## **The Good (What Little There Is)**

- The singleton pattern for AppState is... acceptable, I suppose
- At least you're using TypeScript interfaces
- The lit-html templating isn't completely terrible

## **The Absolutely Horrendous**

### **1. State Management Nightmare**
```javascript
// THIS IS A CRIME AGAINST PROGRAMMING
private activeMajorGodKey: string = "zeus";
private activeBuilding: string | null = null;
private activeEntityKey: string | null = null;
private activeActionsKey: string | null = null;
```

You have FOUR different ways to track "active" things? And you're storing them in localStorage willy-nilly? This is not state management - this is state *mismanagement*. Pick ONE source of truth and stick with it.

### **2. The "Conductor" That Conducts Nothing**
```javascript
// THE CONDUCTOR: Single point of entry for all state changes
setActive(entityKey: string | null, actionsKey: string | null = null) {
```

You call this a "conductor" but it's more like a drunk orchestra member stumbling around. Why are you passing the same key twice (`entityKey, entityKey`)? This screams "I don't understand my own data flow."

### **3. Data Access Patterns Are Atrocious**
```javascript
// This abomination appears EVERYWHERE
const building = Object.values(buildings).find(b => b.name.toLowerCase() === buildingKey);
```

You're doing linear searches through objects constantly. Where are your Maps? Where is your indexing? This O(n) nonsense will kill performance the moment you have more than a handful of entities.

### **4. The Template Functions Are Monstrosities**
Your `majorGodsTemplate` is 50+ lines of spaghetti. Each template function is doing:
- Data filtering
- State checking  
- Event handling
- DOM manipulation concerns
- Business logic

That's not a template - that's a God Object masquerading as a rendering function.

### **5. Global Variables in 2025?**
```javascript
export let data: Civ | null = null;
```

Really? REALLY? "for backward compatibility" - backward compatibility with what, Visual Basic 6?

### **6. The Event Handling Is Amateur Hour**
```javascript
let lastClickTime = 0;
let lastClickEntity = '';
// Manual debouncing? What is this, jQuery from 2010?
```

You're manually implementing debouncing with global variables. Modern frameworks solved this problem a decade ago.

## **Architectural Issues That Make Me Weep**

### **The Data Layer Doesn't Exist**
You're mixing data access, business logic, and presentation concerns in every function. Where's your repository pattern? Where are your services? This isn't architecture - it's anarchy.

### **No Error Boundaries**
```javascript
if (!civData) {
    console.warn("renderAll called before data was loaded. Aborting.");
    return;
}
```

Silent failures everywhere. Your app will just... stop working, and users will have no idea why.

### **The Typing Is A Joke**
```javascript
const collection = this.data[collectionName as keyof Civ] as Record<string, Entity>;
```

`as` casting everywhere because your types don't actually model your data correctly. TypeScript is supposed to help you, not be circumvented with casts.

## **Performance Issues That Hurt My Soul**

1. **Unnecessary re-renders**: Every state change triggers `renderAll()` - rerendering the ENTIRE app
2. **No memoization**: Same calculations repeated constantly
3. **DOM queries**: `document.querySelector` in render functions
4. **Memory leaks**: Event listeners added but not properly cleaned up

## **The Refactor You Actually Need**

### **1. Proper State Architecture**
```typescript
interface AppState {
  activeEntityId: string | null;
  activeView: 'gods' | 'buildings' | 'units';
  // ONE source of truth, not four
}
```

### **2. Repository Pattern**
```typescript
class EntityRepository {
  private entities = new Map<string, Entity>();
  private byType = new Map<EntityType, Set<string>>();
  
  findById(id: string): Entity | null
  findByType(type: EntityType): Entity[]
  // Proper indexing, O(1) lookups
}
```

### **3. Separate Concerns**
- **Data Layer**: Repositories, services
- **Business Logic**: Pure functions, no side effects
- **Presentation**: Dumb templates that just render
- **State Management**: Centralized, predictable updates

### **4. Modern Event Handling**
Use proper event delegation and framework-provided debouncing. Stop rolling your own with global variables.

## **Your TODO List Is Missing The Real Problems**

You're worried about "improving JSON templates" when your entire architecture is fundamentally broken. It's like polishing the brass on the Titanic.

**What you ACTUALLY need to do:**

1. **Complete architectural rewrite** - this codebase is unsalvageable
2. **Proper data modeling** - your entities relationships are a mess
3. **Performance optimization** - stop re-rendering everything
4. **Error handling strategy** - silent failures are user-hostile
5. **Testing infrastructure** - how do you even know this works?

## **Bottom Line**

This codebase is a classic example of "it works" being mistaken for "it's good." It's held together with duct tape, prayers, and localStorage. You've created a maintenance nightmare that will only get worse as you add features.

**My recommendation?** Start over. Seriously. Take your data models, throw away everything else, and rebuild with proper architecture from day one. The technical debt here is insurmountable.

*drops mic, walks away muttering about "junior developers these days"*

**But seriously**, the codebase has good bones and shows you understand the domain well. The main issues are architectural - fixable with some dedicated refactoring time. Want me to help you plan a proper migration strategy?
