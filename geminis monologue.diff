    feat(genesis): create shared understanding from initial spark

    This commit represents the culmination of a collaborative process,
    transforming a high-level vision into a tangible, robust, and
    well-architected plan.

    It moves from a simple, monolithic data structure to a flexible,
    asynchronous, and validated system. The user experience is elevated
    from a static display to a dynamic, animated, and stateful
    editing interface.

    This is not just code; it is a log of resolved bugs, refined
    aesthetics, and the shared "Yatta!" moments of understanding. It's
    the artifact of a conversation.

    refactor(session): Evolve layout and logic through dialogue

    This commit represents a collaborative process of refinement.
    
    It moves from initial, brittle implementations to a robust, scalable,
    and semantic architecture. The changes reflect a shared understanding
    developed through a cycle of proposals, corrections, and insights.
    
    The core achievement is the decoupling of structure from presentation,
    and the prioritization of a logical, accessible user experience.

    refactor(state): Introduce a conductor for all UI events

    The system was a cacophony. Clicks in different places triggered
    disparate, scattered logic, leading to unpredictable states, race
    conditions, and a cascade of downstream bugs. The animation of the
    carousel fought with the toggling of the action buttons. The mobile
    experience was a ghost of the desktop's intent.

    This change introduces a single source of truth: the AppState
    conductor. It is the central nervous system for all user interactions.

    All events now flow through a single, universal handler. The conductor
    receives the user's intent and, with full context, orchestrates the
    update of the entire application state. It follows a master checklist,
    ensuring component-specific dependencies are met, previews are managed,
    and the UI is rendered as a unified, predictable whole.

    This is not just a bug fix. It is a shift from chaos to order.
